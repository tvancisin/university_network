abstract = {We propose the idea of inflections as a method for capturing and conveying interpretative interactions with data visualizations. Aiming to narrow the gap between data analysis and story authoring, inflections are subtle modulations of a visualization's graphical attributes that guide attention, highlight important patterns, and embed communicative cues. By parameterizing view changes and annotations in visualizations, authors can embed insights from their data analysis into story segments and connect them with the respective visualization states. This paper presents the general concept and a technical architecture supporting inflectable data visualizations. By leveraging native web technologies and established visualization conventions, we propose a flexible and extensible approach to inflecting visualizations that link exploratory data analysis and data-driven storytelling.}
